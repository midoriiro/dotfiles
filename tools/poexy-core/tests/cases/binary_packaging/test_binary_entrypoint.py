"""
Test case: Binary package with explicit entry point configuration

This test verifies that poexy-core correctly handles binary packaging when an
explicit entry point is defined in the project configuration. This tests the
creation of executable binaries from Python projects with specified entry points.

Test scenario:
- A project has an explicit entry point configuration in pyproject.toml
- The project is configured for binary format packaging
- The build system creates both wheel and sdist packages
- The resulting binary should be properly installed and executable

Expected behavior:
- The binary executable is created and included in the wheel package
- The binary is installed in the correct bin directory during installation
- No Python package files are installed in site-packages for binary-only format
- Both wheel and sdist formats handle the explicit entry point correctly

Edge case significance:
This tests explicit entry point configuration which is important for projects
that need precise control over binary generation. Explicit entry points ensure
consistent binary naming and behavior across different environments and builds.
