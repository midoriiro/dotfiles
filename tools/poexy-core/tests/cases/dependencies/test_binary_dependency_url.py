Test case: Binary dependency resolution from URL sources

This test verifies that poexy-core correctly handles binary packaging when
dependencies are sourced from direct URLs. URL dependencies must be properly
downloaded, resolved, and integrated into binary executables.

Test scenario:
- A binary project specifies dependencies from direct URLs (e.g., wheel files)
- The build system downloads and resolves URL dependencies during packaging
- The resulting binary executable should include the URL dependency
- Binary execution should work correctly with the integrated URL dependency

Expected behavior:
- URL dependencies are properly downloaded and included in binary packages
- Binary executables function correctly with integrated URL dependencies
- URL dependency resolution works consistently across wheel and sdist formats
- Binary execution produces expected output with URL dependency functionality

Edge case significance:
This tests URL dependency integration in binary packaging which is important
for projects that depend on packages not available in standard indexes.
Proper URL handling ensures binary distributions include all required components.
