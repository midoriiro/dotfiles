"""
Test case: Symbolic link pointing to a directory

This test verifies that poexy-core correctly handles a symbolic link in the
source directory whose final resolved target is a directory.

Test scenario:
- A symlink exists in the source directory pointing (directly or via a chain)
  to a directory inside the project root
- The build system encounters this symlink during file discovery

Expected behavior:
- Directory traversal protections are applied consistently
- The symlink is handled in a predictable way: followed, preserved, or resolved
  according to project policy
- Package integrity is maintained

Edge case significance:
Ensures directory-target symlinks do not lead to accidental traversal or
ambiguous inclusion of files during builds.
