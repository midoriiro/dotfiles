"""
Test case: Symbolic link pointing to a regular file

This test verifies that poexy-core correctly handles a symbolic link in the
source directory whose final resolved target is a regular file.

Test scenario:
- A symlink exists in the source directory pointing (directly or via a chain)
  to a regular file inside the project root
- The build system encounters this symlink during file discovery

Expected behavior:
- The symlink is resolved according to policy without breaking package
  integrity
- For in-project targets, the behavior is predictable (follow/preserve/resolve)

Edge case significance:
Verifies correct handling of file-target symlinks so builds remain stable and
secure under common project layouts.
